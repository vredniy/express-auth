# Simple Auth system based on Express.js and Passport.js

Don't forget about `npm install`.

For comfortable local development you should use [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) `npm i nodemon -g`. nodemon will watch the files in the directory where **nodemon** was started, and if they change, it will automatically restart your node application.

Execute `nodemon app.coffee` to start server.

Hope you enjoy it :)
